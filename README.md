## Background
For this assignment, I take on the role of a new developer at a small bank. My goal is to set up a testnet blockchain for my organization. Therefore, I have to create a custom testnet blockchain, make transaction to test it out, and write an instruction on how to use it.

## My Solution
### Tools
To achieve my goal, first I needed to install:

[MyCrypto](https://mycrypto.com/account)- a free, open-source, client-side interface that allows one to interact directly with the blockchain.

[Go Ethereum](https://geth.ethereum.org/)- one of the three original implementations of the Ethereum protocol. It is written in Go, fully open-source and licensed under the GNU LGPL v3.
